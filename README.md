# Comments
I have not used redux for the state managment as I think as it was a simple application, and atleast these many states should be managed directly by me. 
I have used material ui. 
There is one problem which I am facing and not yet able to solve which occurs on group deletion, in which state does not change well. I will try to figure out myself if not I will seek help.

It was a good learning experience working on it. Thanks.
